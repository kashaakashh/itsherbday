Hey babyyy!
Happy 1 year and 4 months of this beautiful relationship that DOES NOT feel like a burden even after so much time. It feels like a blessing to be with you in this relationship. Not even once i regret being with you. Its still fresh, its still peaceful, its still lovable… its everything what we expect from a relationship. Nothing like what we see around us. We are different and that’s what makes us and this relationship special. We both love each other so much, that we do everything just to meet. You always tell ke main tujhe milne ke liye kitne efforts krta hoon but iss baar jb tu tbiyt khrab mein bhi mujhse milne aayi just because main wait kr raha tha, it made me feel really good. Not that i wanted you to come but i what i felt was special. It made me feel wanted and that is always a special feeling to have. Iss baar toh milkr bohot he mzza aaya and the best part is keeping the sex aside doesn’t change our relationship. Like its not JUST sex in our relationship jo ki isko aur zyada special bnata hai and humein yeh btata hai ke hum ek doosre ke sath future dekh skte hain.. bcz it would not be just sex in the future.. humein ek doosre ke sath ghoomte time kaisa lgta hai.. khaate time kaisa lgta hai, drive krte time kaisa lgta hai.. yeh sb bhi matter krta hai. And hum har cheez mein kitna zyada enjoy krte hain. Aas paas logon ko judge krliya, kbhi kuch krliya aur kbhi kuch.. everything is so so soo good with you aur main jb bhi tere sath hota hoon, i just get one thought that she’s the one jiske sath main poori life spend krna chahta hoon. I love you so much baby girl.

So, har baar ki tarah.. iss baar bhi meri jaan ke liye voh promises karunga main.
I will always be there for you my love. I promise you this.. tujhe kbhi bhi akela nahi chhodunga. Just because i like your happy side more and i want to see you happy hmesha… toh it doesn’t mean ke main tujhe sirf tb pyaar karunga jb tu khush hogi. Nahi meri jaan.. i will be there with you even when you are sad or angry. Tu chahe mere pe he kyun na gussa ho.. i will still stand by your side.
I will always love you with all my heart. Tujhe kbhi bhi main yeh complaint nahi hone dunga ke main tujhpr dhyan nahi deta ya tujhe main kam pyaar krta hoon. With time yeh pyaar bdhega he bdhega.. kbhi kam nahi hoga. Tu jaan hai meri.. there is no one jisko main itna zyada pyaar kr skta hoon. Im very much involved in this relationship and i want to be with you always and forever.
I will always provide you reassurances ke main hmesha tere sath rhunga. Mujhe toh khud bohot mzza aata hai bhyi tujhe btane mein ke how much i love you. Bohot baar toh im out of words ke main tujhe kaise btau ke main kitna zyada pyaar krta hoon jaana tujhe. But still i will always find words to let you know ke main tujhse bohot he zyada pyaar krta hoon meri jaan.
I will always make you happy. Main kbhi bhi intentionally aisa kaam nahi karunga jisse tujhe hurt ho. Tu bohot special hai meri jaan.. tujhe agar kbhi kuch smjhana bhi hoga na toh bhi bohot pyaar se smjhaunga hmesha. Agar kbhi hmare viewpoints kisi cheez mein alg alg bhi hogye na toh bhi main tujhse behes nahi karunga.. ya toh tujhe bohot pyaar se smjhaunga But i will never ever make you feel sad.
I will always respect you my love. Kisi bhi relation mein mere liye pyaar se bhi upar respect aati hai and main tujhe voh hmesha karunga. Tujhe kbhi bhi disrespect nahi krunga. Yes i will roast you or something but kbhi tujhe disrespect nahi karunga. I will always make sure tu hmesha comfortable rahe mere sath.. kbhi bhi tujhe aisa feel na ho ke main agar tujhe roast karunga toh teri beizzti kr rha hoon. Nhi.. i will always keep everything within limits and will always respect you and your feelings.
I will always be loyal to you. Kbhi bhi koi third person hmare beech nahi aayega. You know why im so sure? because we talk. We discuss everything. We let each other know our whole day ke aaj kya hua kya baatein hui.. kisse mille sb kuchh. Hum kuch bhi nahi chhupaate ek doosre se. Yeh cheez hmesha rhegi and kbhi koi third person aane ki jagah he nahi rhegi.
Last promise i wanna do to you is that i will marry you baby. I don’t wanna see a day jisme tu na ho. I want to be with you emotionally, physically, practically sb kuchhh. I just want to marry you and make you feel like the queen of this world. You will always be treated like a queen because you deserve that baby.. you deserve every happy moment a human could feel.

Happy 1 year and 4 months my sweet little baby girl.
I love you the most meri jaanaaaaa❤️
aa jaunga baarat lekar😋❤️💋
