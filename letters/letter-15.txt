hey baby!
happy 1 year 3 months to my cute little princess.
yes, mujhe yaad tha and maine koi alarm bhi nahi lagaya tha.
So this was my birthday month and tbh bohot ache se celebrate kiya yeh birthday aapne.. mujhe bohot mzza aaya. Main toh na bohot time se wait kr raha tha ke bday aane wala hai pta nhi meri madam kya kregi iss baar. But i must say everything was very well planned and i really really enjoyed. No ifs or buts, simply awesome. Poora din sathmein and you just made my 25th bday really special. But fir uske baad main bathinda vapis aa gya and hum tb se nahi mille.. acha toh nahi lgta but thik hai na.. kuch paane ke liye kucu khona toh pdta he hai.. ab agar main shift ho raha hoon toh uske liye thoda toh wait krna he pdega na. And issi se dhyan aaya ke main shift kr raha hoon, toh ab hum kafi frequently mil payenge.. jb mn krega tb mil payenge. This will be like a next step for us and im really looking forward to it. Abhi tk humara long distance chal raha tha.. but ab voh long distance khtm ho jayega. It will be a new start.. we will see how we react with each other when we meet each other more frequently than before. So now is the time for our promises:

I will always be there for you my love. I promise you this.. tujhe kbhi bhi akela nahi chhodunga. Just because i like your happy side more and i want to see you happy hmesha… toh it doesn’t mean ke main tujhe sirf tb pyaar karunga jb tu khush hogi. Nahi meri jaan.. i will be there with you even when you are sad or angry. Tu chahe mere pe he kyun na gussa ho.. i will still stand by your side. 
I will always love you with all my heart. Tujhe kbhi bhi main yeh complaint nahi hone dunga ke main tujhpr dhyan nahi deta ya tujhe main kam pyaar krta hoon. With time yeh pyaar bdhega he bdhega.. kbhi kam nahi hoga. Tu jaan hai meri.. there is no one jisko main itna zyada pyaar kr skta hoon. Im very much involved in this relationship and i want to be with you always and forever.
I will always provide you reassurances ke main hmesha tere sath rhunga. Mujhe toh khud bohot mzza aata hai bhyi tujhe btane mein ke how much i love you. Bohot baar toh im out of words ke main tujhe kaise btau ke main kitna zyada pyaar krta hoon jaana tujhe. But still i will always find words to let you know ke main tujhse bohot he zyada pyaar krta hoon meri jaan.
I will always make you happy. Main kbhi bhi intentionally aisa kaam nahi karunga jisse tujhe hurt ho ya. Tu bohot special hai meri jaan.. tujhe agar kbhi kuch smjhana bhi hoga na toh bhi bohot pyaar se smjhaunga hmesha. Agar kbhi hmare viewpoints kisi cheez mein alg alg bhi hogye na toh bhi main tujhse behes nahi karunga.. ya toh tujhe bohot pyaar se smjhaunga ya fir i will just agree with you because you’re always right😂.
I will always respect you my love. Kisi bhi relation mein mere liye pyaar se bhi upar respect aati hai and main tujhe voh hmesha karunga. Tujhe kbhi bhi disrespect nahi krunga. Yes i will roast you or something (within limits obviously) but kbhi tujhe disrespect nahi karunga. I will always make sure tu hmesha comfortable rahe mere sath.. kbhi bhi tujhe aisa feel na ho ke main agar tujhe roast karunga toh teri beizzti kr rha hoon. Nhi.. i will always keep everything within limits and will always respect you and your feelings.
I will always be loyal to you. Kbhi bhi koi third person hmare beech nahi aayega. You know why im so sure? because we talk. We discuss everything. We let each other know our whole day ke aaj kya hua kya baatein hui.. kisse mille sb kuchh. Hum kuch bhi nahi chhupaate ek doosre se. Yeh cheez hmesha rhegi and kbhi koi third person aane ki jagah he nahi rhegi. Main toh agar kisi ldke ya ldki se baat krunga bhi na toh bhi i would just end up talking about you because tu psnd he itni zyada hai mujhe that i love talking about you. That much i love you.
Last promise i wanna do to you is that i will marry you baby. I don’t wanna see a day jisme tu na ho. I want to be with you emotionally, physically, practically sb kuchhh. I just want to marry you and make you feel like the queen of this world. You will always be treated like a queen because you deserve that baby.. you deserve every happy moment a human could feel.
So, once again happy 1 year and 3 months to my baby girl.
Aa jaunga baarat lekr❤️❤️💋💋💋
I love you so much my babyyyy
