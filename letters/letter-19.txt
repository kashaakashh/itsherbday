Heyy babyyyyy!
Happy 1 year 7 months to the most gorgeous and wonderful person in my life. This was your birthday month and quite a great month we spent. It was fun, adventurous and full of travel for me but it was all worth it because in the end i get the most beautiful gift for my effort — your smile. Ah! that pretty, wicked yet innocent smile of yours. Just can’t get over that. I know last month we both forgot that it was 23rd but not this time. And no, maine koi alarm nahi lagaya tha.. i remembered ke 23rd hai kal. Aur vaise bhi tu konsa koi bhoolne wali cheez hai. Tere liye kiya hua har ek effort ekdum worth it hai pta. Maine kbhi yeh nahi socha ke main iske liye yeh kr raha hoon, aur iske bdle mein mujhe kya yeh ‘xyz’ degi? Nah, i expect nothing… i just enjoy doing stuff for you. Its like im so much in love with you that im like i will just give-give and expect nothing in return because all that matters for me is you and your smile. You my pretty princess, made my life a lot happier and a lot easier. I just want to keep loving you and keep thinking about what else i can gift you. I LOVE purchasing gifts for you. I know bohot cheezein tujhe psnd bhi nahi aayi hongi but i try to get the best things for you and yes i will get better at giving gifts to you that you like. I don’t even think twice before purchasing something for you. I don’t even plan how many gifts i need to give you. I just start searching and anything/everything i like, i just order it. Even on the non-event days, if i ever get an Ad or something, i just save that link with myself because i know it will help me in the future. And i promise you my baby, this will never change. You will always get these pretty gifts. And i promise you to take you out on long drives, late night ice cream dates or movie dates. We will do everything that we dream right now. Everybody will be jealous of our relationship 😋
So, its time for our promises:

I know its hard to always be happy, chahe koi bhi condition ho aap hmesha khush nahi reh skte and that’s how life is. But main tujhe yeh promise krta hoon meri jaan ke main tere sath rhunga. Tu khush hai chahe tu sad hai.. main tere sath khda hoon hmesha. Teri problems mein aur koi ho ya na ho.. i will always be there for you my baby. You know why? bcz sweetheart, i love you❤️ you are my family… aur i will always support you, no matter what. That is a promise from my side.
Teri khushi ka hmesha reason bnu ya na bnu but tere dukh ka reason nahi bnunga main. I promise you baby main tujhe kbhi bhi intentionally hurt ya sad nahi karunga. Tu jaan hai meri.. tu khush rhegi toh mere chehre pr smile rhegi.. toh main tujhe khush rkhne ke liye kuch bhi krunga because i love seeing you happy. 
Baby i promise you ke main kbhi change nahi hounga.. jaisa tujhe main aaj treat krta hoon na vaise he hmesha krunga. Jaise tujhse aaj flirt krta hoon na vaise he hmesha krunga. Agar kuch change hoga mujhme toh voh vhi hoga jo tujhe acha nhi lgta hoga mere mein. Jaise he tu bolegi ke teri yeh cheez achi nahi, ussi time se voh bnd. I know koi bhi perfect nahi ho skta but i want to that person to you jisko dekhkr tu yeh bole ke yeh bnda meri life se jaana nahi chahiye.. he is the one i want.
Baby i will always always respect you. Relationship mein respect hona bohot zroori hai and hmaare relationship mein voh cheez rhi hai shuru se he and i love that. Toh i promise you jaan ke main teri aur teri feelings ki hmesha respect krunga. Kbhi bhi tujhe aisa feel nahi hone dunga jisse tujhe lge ke maine tujhe disrespect kiya ya fir teri feelings ko kbhi nazarandaaz nahi krunga. Tere har ek effort ko main achhe se appreciate krunga because obviously you deserve each and every happiness of this whole wide world.
I promise you jaan ke main tere liye efforts krna kbhi nahi chhodunga. Tere liye efforts krna toh mujhe voh feel deta hai ke main khud ke liye gift le rha hoon. I love doing all this for you.. i feel like main tujhe jitna express kru utna kam hai.. i am madly in love with you aur main tujhe yeh baar baar btata rhunga and tu bhi hmesha khush hokr sunti rhio.
I will never ever break your trust. Yeh main tujhse waada krta hoon ke kbhi tera trust nahi todunga. I know how difficult it is to trust someone and its very much possible ke tu abhi bhi mujhe 100% trust na kr payi ho.. which is acceptable too. Why is it acceptable? because i know main kahin nahi jaane wala.. main yahin hoon tere paas.. tujhe har thode thode time baad reassurance deta rhunga ke jaana main yahin rhunga tere paas, kahin nahi jaane wala main.
I promise you ke main tujhe hmesha pyaar krunga aur hmesha tujhe raani bnakr rkhunga. Main kbhi hmesha tujhe vohi pedestal pr baitha kr rkhunga, jahan tu deserve krti hai. Tujhe duniya ki har khush lakr dunga.. because tu voh sb kuch deserve krti hai meri jaan.

I love you the most my pretty babyyy! ❤️❤️💋💋💋🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Aa jaunga baarat lekar❤️🥰
