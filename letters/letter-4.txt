Happy 4 months to the love of my life, Rachita ❤️
Wow… 4 months.. obviously we are much more closer than a 4 month couple can be. Why? Because we are Rachita-Aakash.. the best couple.. the couple from whom everyone is jealous 😋😏. 
You don’t even know tu mere liye kitni zyada special hai.. main pta poora tujhpr dependent hoon.. maine yeh baat pehle bhi btayi hai but ab dobara bolunga ke main apne din toh different parts mein divide krta hoon.. tere according. Sbse pehle toh yeh ke kaam shuru kiya uske baad tujhe msg krdiya ke meeting hogyi ab main yeh krunga voh krunga. Fir beech beechmein ya toh tere message aate rehte hain ya main krta hoon toh aise time niklta rehta hai tere sahare. Fir teri break hojati hai toh tu tb message krdeti hai.. fir toh bs teri chhuti ki wait rehti hai ke bs iski chhuti ho aur yeh mujhe call kre jldi jldi. Fir toh bs tere sath baki ka din nikaal leta hoon. Main bohot zyada pyaar krta hoon rachita tujhe.. bohot zyada.. kbhi kbhi mujhe darr lgta hai ke kahin main regret na karu itna pyaar krna.. but nahi.. i trust you.. i see the efforts and love in your eyes. You really love me. I know baby.. hum sbko dikha denge ke zroori nahi dating websites pe time pass he krein logg.. jinhone milna hota hai na bhagwan unko kahin se bhi mila deta hai. Bohot baar toh main bhool he jata hoon ke hum hinge se mille hain.. bcz mujhe toh aise feel hota hai ke hum toh bhyi bohot pehle se jaante hain ek doosre ko. 

So, har baar ki tarah.. iss baar bhi meri jaan ke liye voh promises karunga main.
I will always be there for you my love. I promise you this.. tujhe kbhi bhi akela nahi chhodunga. Just because i like your happy side more and i want to see you happy hmesha… toh it doesn’t mean ke main tujhe sirf tb pyaar karunga jb tu khush hogi. Nahi meri jaan.. i will be there with you even when you are sad or angry. Tu chahe mere pe he kyun na gussa ho.. i will still stand by your side. Iss baar jaise tera mood off tha.. i insisted you ke aao mere paas because i wanted to be with you when you were sad. Main tujhe drop krne aaya just to spend some more time with you. This will never change and main hmesha tujhe aise he treat krunga… just like you are my queen🥰
I will always love you with all my heart. Tujhe kbhi bhi main yeh complaint nahi hone dunga ke main tujhpr dhyan nahi deta ya tujhe main kam pyaar krta hoon. With time yeh pyaar bdhega he bdhega.. kbhi kam nahi hoga. Tu jaan hai meri.. there is no one jisko main itna zyada pyaar kr skta hoon. Im very much involved in this relationship and i want to be with you always and forever.
I will always provide you reassurances ke main hmesha tere sath rhunga. Mujhe toh khud bohot mzza aata hai bhyi tujhe btane mein ke how much i love you. Bohot baar toh im out of words ke main tujhe kaise btau ke main kitna zyada pyaar krta hoon jaana tujhe. But still i will always find words to let you know ke main tujhse bohot he zyada pyaar krta hoon meri jaan.
I will always make you happy. Main kbhi bhi intentionally aisa kaam nahi karunga jisse tujhe hurt ho ya. Tu bohot special hai meri jaan.. tujhe agar kbhi kuch smjhana bhi hoga na toh bhi bohot pyaar se smjhaunga hmesha. Agar kbhi hmare viewpoints kisi cheez mein alg alg bhi hogye na toh bhi main tujhse behes nahi karunga.. ya toh tujhe bohot pyaar se smjhaunga ya fir i will just agree with you because you’re always right😂. But i will never ever make you feel sad.
I will always respect you my love. Kisi bhi relation mein mere liye pyaar se bhi upar respect aati hai and main tujhe voh hmesha karunga. Tujhe kbhi bhi disrespect nahi krunga. Yes i will roast you or something (within limits obviously) but kbhi tujhe disrespect nahi karunga. I will always make sure tu hmesha comfortable rahe mere sath.. kbhi bhi tujhe aisa feel na ho ke main agar tujhe roast karunga toh teri beizzti kr rha hoon. Nhi.. i will always keep everything within limits and will always respect you and your feelings.
I will always be loyal to you. Kbhi bhi koi third person hmare beech nahi aayega. You know why im so sure? because we talk. We discuss everything. We let each other know our whole day ke aaj kya hua kya baatein hui.. kisse mille sb kuchh. Hum kuch bhi nahi chhupaate ek doosre se. Yeh cheez hmesha rhegi and kbhi koi third person aane ki jagah he nahi rhegi. Main toh agar kisi ldke ya ldki se baat krunga bhi na toh bhi i would just end up talking about you because tu psnd he itni zyada hai mujhe that i love talking about you. That much i love you.
Last promise i wanna do to you is that i will marry you baby. I don’t wanna see a day jisme tu na ho. I want to be with you emotionally, physically, practically sb kuchhh. I just want to marry you and make you feel like the queen of this world. You will always be treated like a queen because you deserve that baby.. you deserve every happy moment a human could feel.

Yeh saare promises main har month har saal karunga jisse mujhe aur tujhe yaad rahe ke we have to be with each other always and forever. 
God wants to keep love alive in this world so he just helped meeting us because its us who will keep our love go on forever. Our children will tell our love story to their friends and let them know that they have the best mother and the best father.
Rachita and Aakash, Always and forever❤️
I love you so much my princess 👸 
Happy 4 months baby❤️
