Happy 1 year 11 months my beautiful wifeeee.
Aapko kya lga tha main iss baar bhi bhool jaunga? Mzaak hai kyaaa😎😎😎 bhulakkad thodi na hoon main. Main toh bohot samajhdaar aur sb kuch yaad rkhne wala insaan hoon.

So this is the last month when we’re saying “happy 1 year and…” bcz next month se toh Happy 2 year hojayega😋😋 Wow im so excited. Aur issi chlte I will be your longest reigning boyfriend. Lessgggooooo. Sbko hraakr aage niklkr aaya hoon.
Jo cheezein koi aur na kr paya voh maine krke dikhayi😋 bcz you were always worth having… it was their loss that they weren’t able to keep you. I know how to keep my girl happy and I will do that for the rest of my life. The most beautiful person who always supports and helps me… how can I not keep her happy. There is nothing that feels more important to me when I think about you. Yes i know aajkl hmari utni zyada baat nahi ho rhi but its okay.. aapki job lgni bhi toh zroori hai.. tbhi toh main apni biwi ke paison pe aish karunga😈 

So my baby, just like always i will be promising you those 7 things and iss baar bhi yeh saare promises taaze taaze likhe hain and na ki puraane copy pasted hain😰.

I will be there with you always: I promise you my love that i will be there with you always. Abhi toh bs 2 he saal hue hain.. bohot aage jaana hai aur jahan jana hai saath he jana hai.. so yes i will always be there for you my baby.
I will never make you cry: I promise you my baby i will never make you cry intentionally. Haan main koi chhoti moti glti toh krta rhunga but kbhi itni badi glti nahi karunga ke main tujhe rula du. Tu toh mera cutu hai.. tujhe toh khush rkhna hai poora. Tujhe kbhi yeh relationship ko burden ki tarah feel nahi krwaunga. Hmesha hmara relation aisa he rhega ke tu jisko bhi hmare baare mein btayegi toh tu khush hokr he btayegi. Itna khush rkhunga tujhe ke tere aas paas wale tujhse jealous honge aur tujhe bohot special feel hoga.
I will never cheat on you: I promise you meri jaan main tujhpr kbhu bhi cheat nahi karunga. Cheating is the worst thing you can do to your partner. Itna toh humein ek doosre ke baare mein pta chal he gya hai ke hum ek doosre pe cheat nahi krenge but still hmara yeh promise krna farz hai ke hum ek doosre pe kbhi cheat nhi krenge bcz we are SOULMATES. I will never disappoint you my cutu.
I will always respect you: I promise you my angel that i will always always respect you and always make sure that you are not disrespected by me unintentionally. Tere liye na kabhi pyaar kam hoga aur na hi respect. Jitna ek relation mein pyaar zroori hai, utni hi respect bhi. hmare relation mein yeh dono cheezein hmesha rhengi. Tujhe kbhi bhi kisi bhi cheez ke liye.. na toh public mein and na he private mein kbhi disrespected feel nhi hone dunga. 
I will always love you with all my heart: I promise you my cutu baby that i will always love you with all my heart and no one will ever take your place. You are the smile of my life.. toh main apni khushi ho kahin aur kyun jaane dunga. Toh main tujhe hmesha itna zyada pyaar dunga na ke tu kahin jaa he nahi payegi. Aur yeh pyaar kbhi kam nahi hoga jaana.. hmesha bdhta he rhega. 
I will always give you regular reassurances: I promise you my sweetheart that i will always give you these random reassurances because thats what a person should do.. always make sure ke aapka partner jaanta ho ke aap usse kitna zyada pyaar krte ho. Voh chahe instagram reels ke sath ek pyara sa message ho ya fir glti krne ke baad ek sorry ho.. jaisa mrzi ho bs meri duty yehi hai ke main aapko regularly btata rahu ke main aapse kitna pyaar krta hoon.
I will marry you: I promise you meri jaana.. i will marry you. Mujhe nahi pta shaadi se pehle hum ek jagah pe honge ya long distance chlra hoga but main itna zroor kehta hoon ke hum khush honge.. aur ek doosre se shadi krne wale honge. I can’t imagine my life jisme tu nahi hai.. bcz tu toh ab hai he.. baki sb kuch ho na ho.. tu toh rhegi. I love you so muchhhh!

Just one more month and we’ll take another step.

Thankyou for being there. You will never regret choosing me.

Aa jaunga baarat lekar
